cocos creator 2.2.0 orientation change


cocos creator 2.2.0 can not achieve orientation change on android.

this is a fixup though you can upgrade to 2.2.1 etc, then you don't need this fixup.


Some explanation

the hall: is portrait
the game: landscape fitHeight(the design is too wide, so chopped at far left and far right), or portrait fitWidth(the design is not high enough, so at the top and bottom, there are black background).
